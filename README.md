# Ref Returns and Ref Locals in C# 7.0
C# 7.0 introduces ref returns and ref locals. The main goal of these new features is to make it easier for developers to pass around references to value types instead of copies of their values. 

This is important when working with large data structures that are implemented as value types. 

C# 7.0 introduces support for ref returns and locals. This way we can move value type references between method calls instead of copies of values.
